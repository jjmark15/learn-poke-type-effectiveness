# PokeLearn

## Intro

PokeLearn is my fun little side project where I combine a desire to not be completely ignorant of all front-end software development and my minor obsession with Pokemon.

The app is currently a simple game where you can test your knowledge of Pokemon type effectiveness.

It is hosted [here](https://pokelearn.vercel.app/).

## Development

The project is setup with `pnpm` as the package manager and SvelteKit as the JavaScript framework. To start the dev server locally run `pnpm run dev`.
